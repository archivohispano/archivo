My God, have mercy on me. Give me your light. Give me your eternal life. I beg that my mission be made clear to me, and that you give me the means to fulfill it to your satisfaction. Let your will be done in me exclusively, and no other.

Grant me the humility and meekness of Our Lord Jesus Christ—his love, his forgiveness, and his charity for those who sacrificed him.

May these be our feelings toward those who have wronged us, toward those who attempt to harm us, and toward those who succeed in doing us harm.

Deliver us from hatred, from the thirst for vengeance, from resentment against them. We pray that the Holy Spirit be with each and every one of them, that they be purified, sanctified, and anointed by your Divine Grace; that in them be done exclusively your Holy and Divine Will; that your peace, your joy, your happiness, and your glory be theirs as well; that those feelings of love, forgiveness, and charity of Our Lord Jesus Christ be reconciled with us, and that in those same feelings we reconcile ourselves with them—for the good of the Homeland and of Humanity.

We pray that Our Lord Jesus Christ may accompany us, never abandon us, live within us; that He may send us the Holy Spirit to keep us in a state of grace and make us worthy of the glory of being an expression of the Holy Spirit and of Divine Justice. Grant us the talent, the discernment, the intelligence, the wisdom, the genius, and the eternal vision of the Savior; his Courage, his Heroism, his infinite power to endure the pain of sacrifice, the grace and the resurrection of eternal life; his Energy, his Health, his Beauty, his Youth, his Virility at all times; his infinite Goodness, his Tenderness, his Gentleness, his Affection, his Fineness, his Humility, his Meekness, his Majesty.

We pray for the strength to carry the cross of martyrdom with his Majesty; and that the cross may cast no shadow but always be arms of eternal light—no matter the path of the pilgrim in search of Divine Strength.

Grant us the grace to reject all evil against us and to undo it. We see clearly our mission of liberation. The suffering that fulfilling it may bring, according to your Divine Will, must be a joy—for your will is Glory.

We implore Eternal Grace, that we may be worthy to meet you when you call us, before your divine presence, where our loved ones dwell.

We ask all this in the name of your Divine Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ.

**Amen.**
