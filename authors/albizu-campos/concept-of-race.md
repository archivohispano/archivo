When the President of the Republic of the Plata, Don Hipólito Yrigoyen, instituted the Day of la Raza, to which race was the Argentine statesman referring? Was his concept, with an old-world bias, excluding the rest of the great ethnic mosaic of the Americas? The Argentine president was referring to the Ibero-American race.

For us, race has nothing to do with biology—neither moonlit skin, nor curled hair, nor the slant of the eye. Race is a perpetuation of virtues and characteristic institutions. We are distinguished by our culture, our courage, our nobility, and our Catholic sense of civilization.

When the Spanish unification was achieved through the union of the Aragonese and Castilian kingdoms, and independence was won with the expulsion of the Moors, Spain, full of itself, launched into the epic of the Discovery—the greatest epic of modern times: the discovery of man by man. God only knows what moral cataclysm made possible the separation of humanity to the point of forgetting itself!

With the Discovery, Spain conquered human unity, gave the world its geographic unity, and made the earth a sphere. Man did not know where he lived—his map of residence was a mere conjecture. Spain gave him the assurance of stability, and once he felt firm ground beneath him, man began to move forward again. The Discovery opened the path for all modern investigation in philosophical and natural sciences. It not only systematized the science of oceanic navigation but also brought humanity consciousness of the cosmos—set man sailing in a vast fleet of constellations through infinite space.

Is the cosmos infinite in the eternal perspective of that boundless expanse, or is its destiny a perpetual clustering and unclustering within the miracle of creation?

The primacy of the Spanish race in Europe proved the benefit that a balance of courage and sanctity can bring to the world. There is a historical experience that calls us to seek ourselves in order to restore balance to the world. Today, the sense of race re-emerges victorious.

The yellow races regroup in the East to save themselves. Japan feels providentially destined to rebuild Asian unity. The Ethiopian races likewise react in Africa. The Anglo-Saxons are quickly organizing in opposition to Latinity. It is a hidden law of U.S. policy to follow the inertia of its mother country, Great Britain.

All peoples possess our spiritual weapons, because we were the ones who, by blood and fire—with the cross of the sword and the sword of the cross—gave old Europe and virgin America the tradition of virtue, courage, honor, sacrifice, and contempt for death and material goods. Today, that makes our race the only remaining hope of the world.

In these moments, when Europe trembles before the prospect of war, the peace of the Universe rests in the hands of two men of our race. With full faith in our racial values, the world has placed its fate in the hands of two of our own: Don Salvador de Madariaga and Linazo, from Spain and Argentina, respectively, confront—calmly, serenely, responsibly—the problem of peace, under the ideal of our race raised on the banner of Christianity, the same banner with which our friars brought civilization to half the planet and our heroes circled the globe.

Are there dangers? For our Race, danger has never existed.
